                        <br>
                          <p> (Adapted from “No Pianos, Pets, or Foreigners! My Life in Japan in the80s”)</p>

                    position:relative;">
                        <p>Finding a place to live in Japan as a foreigner is no small task. When I first moved to Japan, the prefabricated house I moved into was secured for me by the local Japanese Education office. The Japanese government became my guarantor with ultimate responsibility for my actions, though I was paying the monthly rent. I lived there for two years without any issues and loved it.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>A rude awakening came when I was accepted to work for a small Japanese company in Tokyo. The finance director at the company was assigned to take me around looking for an apartment or condominium to rent. In Japan, the condominium is called a “mansion” in Japanese, though it is anything but. We began looking in the prefecture just outside of Tokyo, which is called “Saitama”. There was a running joke if you were from Saitama. The people in Tokyo would call it “The Saitama” and shorten it to the slang word “Da Sai”, with the meaning being something that was not “cool”. However, Saitama was a great place and we began looking for a “mansion” in various towns.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2><b>No Pianos, Pets, Or Foreigners</b></h2>
                        <p>In those days, the internet did not exist, so we had to rely on those hard copy apartment/mansion catalogs which featured listings, details, and rent for all of the properties in the area. Shockingly to me, one of the prominent phrases in many (most) of the ads was “no pianos, pets, or foreigners”. Many times, we would visit a realtor’s office and as soon as I opened the door, one of the realtors would say in a loud voice, “Sorry, we don’t handle foreigners!”</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In one instance, I was told they didn’t handle foreigners, but they were willing to call other places to see if anyone else did. When the woman got the other realtor on the line, she covered the receiver and said “They want to know what country you’re from.” That was the last straw for me that day, as I felt now the discrimination was going to be based on a person’s country? Seriously? I walked out at that point. Actually, before I walked out, I said “Tell them I’m from deepest, darkest Africa!” Not my finest moment.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Eventually, I was able to locate a mansion with two 6-mat rooms and a large kitchen with a wooden floor, so I could put a kitchen table there. This worked out well. The building also had an outdoor parking lot for a minimal additional fee. I got married and lived with my Japanese wife there for three years before a new job at a large market research company required us to move.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2><b>Japanese Wife But Still No Foreigners</b></h2>
                        <p>This time, I felt it would be easier, as my wife was Japanese. Regardless, we were still running into the no pianos, pets, or foreigners dilemma. We looked high and low for something we would be happy with. We finally found a mansion that was in a very large building with many individual units. I think we were looking at a unit on the 9th floor. The realtor was very kind and we loved the layout. The monthly rent was also quite reasonable. The realtor said everything should be fine, but she would have to talk to the owner to see if having a foreigner live there was okay or not. She assured us it was just a formality since my wife was Japanese and I could speak Japanese and understood the culture.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Well, it turned out it was not okay and the owner did not want to rent to a foreigner. The realtor was very apologetic and felt bad. I suggested that I meet with the owner face to face and was sure that once he met me and realized I could speak Japanese fluently and had lived in Japan for five years already, he would be more than willing to rent to us. I tried not to take these situations too personally, as I was the one who chose to live in Japan and therefore, should follow the rules of that culture. The owner agreed to meet with me at the building.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2><b>Meeting With The Owner</b></h2>
                        <p>I started by giving him the traditional bow and then talked about how I had worked for the Japanese government department of education and was now working for a Japanese company in Tokyo and I intended to live in Japan for many years. He let me finish my story, thanked me for my time, and said he was very sorry, but he just could not rent the apartment to me. I asked him why not and his answer is one I will never forget. He said “It’s not because you’re a foreigner. It’s just because you are not Japanese.” Somehow this logic made sense to him and I realized at that moment there was no way I was going to change his mind; it was time to move on.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2><b>Blessing In Disguise</b></h2>
                        <p>Instead of living in that giant building with one apartment on top of the other, our realtor found us a brand new mansion that was only four stories tall. The unit we fell in love with was a corner unit on the third floor, right next to a beautiful Japanese temple with lots of green all around in a very quiet area. It was what they called a 2 LDK. LDK stands for living room, dining room, and kitchen. It had two 6-mat rooms, one with tatami mats and one with carpeting. It also had a very large living-dining area and a small kitchen.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It had a security intercom system on the ground floor so people had to be buzzed in for the entryway doors to open. It was located in Tokyo and almost twice the price of the mansion we had in Saitama, but we decided it was worth it. We had to rent a parking space a couple of blocks away for our car, but we couldn’t be happier. The woman who was the landlord was very nice and would come and visit with us a couple of times per year to see how we were doing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2><b>Have Things Changed?</b></h2>
                        <p>Though my experience took place in the 80s, I have been back to Japan every year since. I love the country, but my understanding is not much has changed regarding foreigners seeking apartments. If you have lived in Japan, please let me know your experiences and thoughts on this matter.

                        </p>
