                        <p>Hello friends. My name is Monica. This is my blog, so I request you please tell me how you feel it and whether any addition, deletion and edition needed.</p>
                        
                        <p>So my blog is on Uttarakhand Short Trip.</p>
                   
                        <p>Uttarakhand is known as Land of God due to various shrine are located it. But also it is surrounded by beauty of nature which makes it exquisite.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Day 1: My journey started from Pune. From Pune we take morning flight at 6.00 am and reached there at 1.30 pm. I want to tell you its called Dehradun airport but the actual airport is situated in Rishikesh as per distance consider. We hired car and reached to our Haridwar hotel which was already booked. Well Haridwar has narrow lanes and sometimes car cannot reach to the hotel and same happened with us hence our car dropped us 500 meter away from hotel and from there we went to hotel by walk. In hotel the staff told us that the Ganga Arti Started at 5 pm and they can help us to book a seat for us (With some commission of course).</p>

                     
                        <p>We got fresh and went out to explore the city little bit and went to back hotel to get ready for Ganga Arti. The Arti experience is beyond words. I would suggest try to get seat at place where all Pandits and Pujari doing Arati rather than Opposite side. At night we tried Mathura Pethwale(The Original one) and it was great.</p>

                       
                        <p>Day 2: We woke up early and left hotel at 6.30 am. There are lots of places from where you can buy ticket of Ropeway and I suggest you buy complete package of it. We took ropeway and went for darshan of Mansa Devi and Chandi Devi. You need to go these places through ropeway and the view from which is exhilarating. After Darshan of Mata Rani we took breakfast at Mathura Puriwale which is famous place and food wad good. We take darshan of all temples at Hari ki Pauri. And came back hotel to take rest. In evening we hired Auto Rickshaw and it takes us nearby Haridwar all famous places which was mostly temples and in evening we again attend Ganga Arti but this time opposite side of the Pujari and Pandits.</p>
                        

                        <p>Day 3: we start day early and take share auto for Rishikesh. (You can easily get Share Rickshaw to go Rishikesh from Haridwar hence do not spend money on car)We reached Rishikesh from there we went to Laxman Jhula, Bharat Mata Mandir and all nearby temples. One thing is sure that the Ganga River is much cleaner on side of Rishikesh. Near bharat Mata Mandir we took sharing Jeep and went to Neelkanth Mahadev Temple. It said that after Lord Shiva drink Halahal Vish he came to this place and done the meditation. We came from the temple took a lunch and had Arti at Triveni Ghat. Personally I Liked this Aarti more.</p>
                        
                        <p>Day 4: We hired car today and we started journey for Devprayaag. It is one of five Prayag which all located in Uttarakhand. Here Alaknanad and Bhagirathi River met and takes name Ganga. People also told that its Triveni Sangam means three rivers are met, Bhagirathi,Alaanknanda and Sarswati River. As per Hindu Mythology Sarswati River got a curse of Brahma and hence it's not visible to eyes. I must say do not miss this Place. It said that after killing Ravana in war the Lord Rama is came to this place to pray to god to forgive him to kill Brahmin Ravana. Here one temple which is dedicated to Lord Rama name "Raghunath Temple". The temple closed at 12.00 pm and again opens at 4.30 pm. So make sure you take Darshan in time. Here is one famous sweet called Singori which is basically Khoya wrapped in Maalu Leaves. I dint find it great but you can give try. On way to Rudraprayag here are lots of places like Valmiki Cave, etc you can take Darshan of all. At night we return back to hotel at Haridwar. (You can take hotel in Rishikesh also as we got the booking from m company hence we stay there only to save some money.)</p>
                
                        
                    
                        <p>Day 5: Today we started journey to Dehradun from Haridwar. On route we went to Tapkeshwar, Sahstradhara, Tapovan and Robbers Cave. I must say do not miss Robbers Cave. It's one of the experiences. We reached to our hotel and take rest. In evening we went out to explore the city and its food culture. (One can go to Hanol Temple also if time permits)</p>
                        

                        <p>Day 6: Today we start journey to Mindrolling Monasetry. Well its depend on person to person but you can skip this if you already seen any Monasetry.Then we went Forest research Institute. The architecture of building is beautiful and for this must see place. While returning back we went to Dehradun Zoo which nothing great as usual zoo. In evening we went to Mussoorie. On way there is (I suggest hired car from Dehradun only as Mussoorie Car service is very costly).</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Day 7: Today we went to Mussoorie outing like Kempty Fall, Clouds End, Gun Hill, Garden, Mussoorie Lake, etc and evening you can explore Mall road. I didn't find anything exciting shopping opportunity here. We also tried Lovely Omlette. Well I found its regular one but as its famous place you can give try.</p>
                        
                        <p>Day 8: We went to Tehri Dam. It is one of the highest levels Dam in the world. There is beautification done along the dam and Boating and other water sport facility are there. This place should not be missing. On return we went to Kantal which was on way. It is just a place of Forest as I am Nature loving person we just went here small walk and return back. After that on way only we went to Dhanauti where one garden was situated which was not so great and Surkunda Mata Mandir is there. If you have stamina then only go to this temple as it's hard to climb.</p>

                        <p>Day 9: We take local bus and reached to Dehradun from there we hired card and start our journey back to home with all sweet memories.</p>
